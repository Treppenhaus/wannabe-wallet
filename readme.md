i made this to create ethereum wallets which have a cool prefix.

if you want an address like `0x696900006ba27467555eb562121fac00d24e9dd2` for example

of course the code is slow af and not optimized, also you wouldnt run a nodejs app for that case. But as long as you dont make the searched prefix too complicated it works well.
